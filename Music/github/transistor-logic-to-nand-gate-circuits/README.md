# Transistor Logic to NAND Gate Circuits

This project demonstrates the construction of logic gates using only transistors, followed by building complex logic circuits using only NAND gates.

## Overview

- Basic logic gates built from discrete transistors (e.g., AND, OR, NOT)
- Implementation of universal logic using only NAND gates
- Arduino-based verification and simulation

## Files

- `transistor_logic_nand_circuits.ino`: Arduino code used for testing or simulating logic gates
- `circuit_diagram.png`: Placeholder for circuit diagram image (add your own)
- `photos/`: Folder for breadboard and project images or videos

## How to Use

1. Review the schematic in `circuit_diagram.png`
2. Upload the Arduino code to test gate behavior
3. Explore `notes.txt` for in-depth understanding of logic design
